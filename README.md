 🐾 Dog-Cat Classification CNN Project 🐾

Welcome to the Dog-Cat Classification CNN project! 🐶🐱 This project, developed on Google Colab, is designed to classify images of adorable dogs and cute cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). During testing, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 80%, and it was validated with a set of personal pet photos.

## 🐾 Features

- **Binary Classification:** The model distinguishes between images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- **CNN Architecture:** Utilizes a CNN architecture with layers for convolution, batch normalization, max-pooling, and dense connections.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances model generalization through data augmentation techniques during training.
- **Transfer Learning:** Explores transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet for improved feature extraction.

## 📷 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning. It consists of labeled images of delightful dogs and charming cats, segmented into training and testing sets.
