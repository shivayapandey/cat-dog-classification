 🐾 Dog-Cat Classification CNN Project 🐾

Welcome to the Dog-Cat Classification CNN project! 🐶🐱 This project, developed on Google Colab, is designed to classify images of adorable dogs and cute cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). During testing, the model achieved an accuracy rate of 80%, and it was validated with a set of personal pet photos.

🐾 Features
Binary Cutie-pication: The model is trained to recognize the charm of dogs 🐶 and the purr-fection of cats 🐱.
Whisker-tastic CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks work their magic to understand those adorable details in the images.
Furr-tastic Augmentation: Data augmentation ensures the model is trained on a diverse set of paw-sibilities.
Transfer Learning Tail: Consider experimenting with transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to capture intricate features.
📷 Dataset
The dataset comprises snapshots of delightful doggos and charming kitties, divided into training and testing sets. Achieving an 80% accuracy rate, the model was also validated with personal pet photos.

📈 Model Performance
Monitor the model's training and validation accuracy and loss with these visualizations:

🧐 Evaluation Metrics
Consider exploring additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, especially if there's an imbalance between the number of dog and cat images.

🌟 Next Steps
Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques for model tuning.
Check for signs of overfitting and apply techniques like dropout and regularization if needed.
Explore transfer learning with pre-trained models for improved feature extraction.
Feel free to clone, explore, and play with the code. Don't forget to share your feedback, and happy classifying with your own pet photos! 🐾✨
